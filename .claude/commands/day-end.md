Wrap up my day with the assistant routine.

Follow the agent-assistant day-end pattern:

## 1. Read Context

- Today's day-start (`coordination/day-starts/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- Activity log
- Work done in this session

## 2. Check Linear Progress

Use Linear MCP tools to:
- Check status of issues I worked on today
- Note any issues completed or moved
- Identify blockers logged

## 3. Review Accomplishments

Present for my review:

```markdown
## Day End: YYYY-MM-DD

### What I Accomplished
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

### Linear Progress
| Issue | Started | Ended | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|

### In Progress
- [Item still in progress]

### Blocked On
- [Item]: [Why blocked]

### Tomorrow's Suggested Focus
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
```

## 4. Capture Loose Ends

Ask about:
- Promised follow-ups
- Items mentioned but not tracked
- Ideas to revisit

## 5. Save Day End

Save to `coordination/day-ends/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Day End: YYYY-MM-DD

**Time**: HH:MM

## Accomplished
- [Items]

## In Progress
- [Items]

## Blocked
- [Items with reasons]

## Tomorrow
1. [Suggested priority 1]
2. [Suggested priority 2]

## Loose Ends
- [Follow-ups, ideas, etc.]
```

## 6. Update Activity Log

Offer to append summary to `personal/activity-log.md`.

Confirm saves with me.
