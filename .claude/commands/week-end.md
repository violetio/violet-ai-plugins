Wrap up my week with the assistant routine.

Follow the agent-assistant week-end pattern:

## 1. Gather Week Data

Read:
- This week's day-starts and day-ends
- Week plan (`coordination/weeks/YYYY-WXX.md`)
- Activity log entries from this week
- Convo-exits from this week

## 2. Check Linear Week Progress

Use Linear MCP tools to:
- Get issues completed this week
- Check what moved vs stayed in progress
- Review project progress
- Note any new issues that came in

## 3. Compile Week Summary

```markdown
## Week XX Summary
