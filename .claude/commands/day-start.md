Start my day with the assistant routine.

Follow the agent-assistant day-start pattern:

## 1. Read Context

- **Inbox** (`personal/inbox.md`) - Ideas and tasks to process
- Activity log (`personal/activity-log.md` if available)
- Weekly coordination file
- Recent convo-exits
- Previous day-start/day-end outputs

## 2. Check Linear

Use the Linear MCP tools to:
- Get issues assigned to me (my open tasks)
- Check project status for projects I'm involved in
- Review any initiatives or cycles with upcoming deadlines

## 3. Surface Priorities

Present for my review:

```markdown
## Good Morning

### Linear Tasks (Assigned to Me)
| Issue | Title | Status | Priority | Due |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|-----|

### Active Projects
| Project | Status | My Role |
|---------|--------|---------|

### From Inbox
- [ ] [High priority items from personal/inbox.md]

### Today's Focus
1. [Highest priority]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

### Deadlines This Week
- [Day]: [Item]

### Carried Over from Yesterday
- [Items not completed]

### Reminders & Follow-ups
- [Promised follow-up]
```

## 4. Review with Me

Ask me to:
- Confirm or adjust today's priorities
- Flag any blockers
- Add anything missing

## 5. Save Day Start

Save this day-start to `coordination/day-starts/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create directory if needed):

```markdown
# Day Start: YYYY-MM-DD

**Time**: HH:MM

## Linear Snapshot
[Tasks and projects from above]

## Planned Focus
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

## Notes
[Any adjustments or context from our review]
```

Confirm the save location with me.
