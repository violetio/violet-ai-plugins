Start my week with the assistant routine.

Follow the agent-assistant week-start pattern:

## 1. Review Prior Week

Read:
- Last week's day-starts and day-ends
- Last week's coordination file (`coordination/weeks/YYYY-W{N-1}.md`)
- Activity log entries from last week

Summarize:
- What was completed
- What carried over
- Key wins and learnings

## 2. Check Linear for the Week

Use Linear MCP tools to:
- Get all issues assigned to me
- Check project statuses and milestones
- Review initiative/cycle deadlines
- Identify what's due this week vs later

## 3. Present Week Plan

```markdown
## Week of YYYY-MM-DD
